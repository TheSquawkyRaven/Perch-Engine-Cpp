# Perch-Engine-Cpp
```
An SDL2 game engine implemented with C++
```

## Tree/Branch System

Perch engine uses a hierarchical layout to represent "objects", in this case each "object" is a branch.

This system is inspired by Godot's node system, and represents the "objects" in game as branches to form a tree, with the root being a branch itself.
